boxalino tracking
=================

Overview
--------

The boxalino tracking is used to track events necessary for trigger emails, search and recommendation personalization, self learning and reporting.

The preferred way to integrate the boxalino tracking, is to use the latest javascript library directly from our CDN:
https://cdn.bx-cloud.com/frontend/rc/js/ba.min.js

This repository contains the same version of that library for those customers who prefer to store this library on their own servers. This repository can easily be integrated as a submodule into another git repository or be used to subscribe and receive notifications on updates of this library.


Usage

The detailed usage description and documentation of this library can be found here:
